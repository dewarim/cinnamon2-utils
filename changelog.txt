- 

0.6.8
Moved some more classes to remove cyclic dependency.

0.6.7
moving some classes to Utils. There is now a cyclic dependency between EntityLib and Utils,
so for the first build you may have to create a entitylib-source-jar and add it temporarily to Utils.

0.6.6
Removed Constants.POST_LOG and COMMAND_LOG.
	 If you really need them, please use Conf and store them in cinnamon_config.xml.

0.6.5
new: ConfThreadLocal: getSessionExpirationTime(String repository_name).

0.6.4
API changed:
OSD.contentPath is now stored without full path information (just the path below $repository),
that is: /home/zimt/cinnamon-data/cmn_test is omitted.

0.5.8
added Constants.FOLDER_TYPE_DEFAULT="_default_folder_type"
added Conf.getApiClasses which returns a list of ApiClasses (to define the public API of 
a Cinnamon repository).
  
0.5.7
Cleaned up Conf and ConfThreadLocal. You should use the latter instead of the former.

Added utils.ContentReader to help slurping character based content into a string in one go.
Added several constants. 

0.5.6
added server.data.MSSQLServerNativeDialect to enable automatic creation of Unicode fields
 instead of the classic, collation-dependent MSSQL-column types. (So now Hibernate will generate
 nvarchar instead of varchar).
 *** NOTE ***
 Make sure that your persistence.xml uses this class instead of the traditional SQLServerDialect.
  
0.5.5
moved dateToIsoString to ParamParser.
 
0.5.4
server.global.Constants: added several database related fields.
