    that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these guidelines are kept,
    we expect to continue enhancing this system and expect to make other tools available as
    they are completed.</p>

THIS SPECIFICATION TO YOU
ONLY UPON THE CONDITION THAT YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE
TERMS CONTAINED IN THIS
AGREEMENT. PLEASE READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY
DOWNLOADING THIS SPECIFICATION, YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS
AND CONDITIONS OF THE
AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO BE BOUND BY IT,

AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE.


Specification: JSR-000220 Enterprise JavaBeans(tm)
("Specification")


Version: 3.0
Status: Final Release
Release: 8 May 2006
Copyright 2006 SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC.

4150 Network Circle, Santa Clara, California 95054,
U.S.A

All rights reserved.
LIMITED LICENSE GRANTS


1. License for Evaluation Purposes. Sun hereby grants
you a fully-paid,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited
license (without the right
to sublicense), under Sun's applicable intellectual
property rights to view,
download, use and reproduce the Specification only for
the purpose of internal
evaluation. This includes (i) developing applications
intended to run on an
implementation of the Specification, provided that
such applications do not
themselves implement any portion(s) of the
Specification, and (ii) discussing
the Specification with any third party; and (iii)
excerpting brief portions of
the Specification in oral or written communications
which discuss the
Specification provided that such excerpts do not in
the aggregate constitute a
significant portion of the Specification.


2. License for the Distribution of Compliant
Implementations. Sun also grants
you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
worldwide, fully paid-up,
royalty free, limited license (without the right to
sublicense) under any
applicable copyrights or, subject to the provisions of
subsection 4 below,
patent rights it may have covering the Specification
to create and/or distribute
an Independent Implementation of the Specification
that: (a) fully implements
the Specification including all its required
interfaces and functionality; (b)
does not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend
the Licensor Name Space,
or include any public or protected packages, classes,
Java interfaces, fields or
methods within the Licensor Name Space other than
those required/authorized by
the Specification or Specifications being implemented;
and (c) passes the
Technology Compatibility Kit (including satisfying the
requirements of the
applicable TCK Users Guide) for such Specification
("Compliant Implementation").
In addition, the foregoing license is expressly
conditioned on your not acting
outside its scope. No license is granted hereunder for
any other purpose
(including, for example, modifying the Specification,
other than to the extent
of your fair use rights, or distributing the
Specification to third parties).
Also, no right, title, or interest in or to any
trademarks, service marks, or
trade names of Sun or Sun's licensors, Sun or the
Sun's licensors is granted
hereunder. Java, and Java-related logos, marks and
names are trademarks or
registered trademarks of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in the
U.S. and other countries.


3. Pass-through Conditions. You need not include
limitations (a)-(c) from the
previous paragraph or any other particular "pass
through" requirements in any
license You grant concerning the use of your
Independent Implementation or
products derived from it. However, except with respect
to Independent
Implementations (and products derived from them) that
satisfy limitations
(a)-(c) from the previous paragraph, You may neither:
(a) grant or otherwise
pass through to your licensees any licenses under
Sun's applicable intellectual
property rights; nor (b) authorize your licensees to
make any claims concerning
their implementation's compliance with the Spec in
question.


4. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses.


a. With respect to any patent claims covered by the
license granted under
subparagraph 2 above that would be infringed by all
technically feasible
implementations of the Specification, such license is
conditioned upon your
offering on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory
terms, to any party seeking
it from You, a perpetual, non-exclusive,
non-transferable, worldwide license
under Your patent rights which are or would be
infringed by all technically
feasible implementations of the Specification to
develop, distribute and use a
Compliant Implementation.


b With respect to any patent claims owned by Sun and
covered by the license
granted under subparagraph 2, whether or not their
infringement can be avoided
in a technically feasible manner when implementing the
Specification, such
license shall terminate with respect to such claims if
You initiate a claim
against Sun that it has, in the course of performing
its responsibilities as the
Sun, induced any other entity to infringe Your patent
rights.


c Also with respect to any patent claims owned by Sun
and covered by the license
granted under subparagraph, where the infringement of
such claims can be avoided
in a technically feasible manner when implementing the
Specification such
license, with respect to such claims, shall terminate
if You initiate a claim
against Sun that its making, having made, using,
offering to sell, selling or
importing a Compliant Implementation infringes Your
patent rights.


5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement:
"Independent Implementation"
shall mean an implementation of the Specification that
neither derives from any
of Sun's source code or binary code materials nor,
except with an appropriate
and separate license from Sun, includes any of Sun's
source code or binary code
materials; "Licensor Name Space" shall mean the public
class or interface
declarations whose names begin with "java", "javax",
"com.sun" or their
equivalents in any subsequent naming convention
adopted by Sun through the Java
Community Process, or any recognized successors or
replacements thereof; and
"Technology Compatibility Kit" or "TCK" shall mean the
test suite and
accompanying TCK User's Guide provided by Sun which
corresponds to the
Specification and that was available either (i) from
Sun's 120 days before the
first release of Your Independent Implementation that
allows its use for
commercial purposes, or (ii) more recently than 120
days from such release but
against which You elect to test Your implementation of
the Specification.


This Agreement will terminate immediately without
notice from Sun if you breach
the Agreement or act outside the scope of the licenses
granted above.


DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES


THE SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS". SUN MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NON-INFRINGEMENT
(INCLUDING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ANY PRACTICE OR
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
SPECIFICATION), OR THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE
SPECIFICATION ARE SUITABLE FOR ANY
PURPOSE. This document does not represent any
commitment to release or implement
any portion of the Specification in any product. In
addition, the Specification
could include technical inaccuracies or typographical
errors.


LIMITATION OF LIABILITY


TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION,
LOST REVENUE, PROFITS OR
DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF
LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR HAVING, IMPELEMENTING OR
OTHERWISE USING USING THE
SPECIFICATION, EVEN IF SUN AND/OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE
BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

You will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Sun and
its licensors from any
claims arising or resulting from: (i) your use of the
Specification; (ii) the
use or distribution of your Java application, applet
and/or implementation;
and/or (iii) any claims that later versions or
releases of any Specification
furnished to you are incompatible with the
Specification provided to you under
this license.


RESTRICTED RIGHTS LEGEND


U.S. Government: If this Specification is being
acquired by or on behalf of the
U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime
contractor or subcontractor (at
any tier), then the Government's rights in the
Software and accompanying
documentation shall be only as set forth in this
license; this is in accordance
with 48 C.F.R. 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for
Department of Defense (DoD)
acquisitions) and with 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212 (for
non-DoD acquisitions).

If you provide Sun with any comments or suggestions
concerning the Specification
("Feedback"), you hereby: (i) agree that such Feedback
is provided on a
non-proprietary and non-confidential basis, and (ii)
grant Sun a perpetual,
non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, irrevocable
license, with the right to
sublicense through multiple levels of sublicensees, to
incorporate, disclose,
and use without limitation the Feedback for any
purpose.

The Entitlement may be delivered to you in various ways depending on the manner
in which you obtain Software and Services, for example, the Entitlement may be
provided in your receipt, invoice or your contract with Sun or authorized Sun
reseller.  It may also be in electronic format if you download Software.

3.  Permitted Use.

As selected in your Entitlement, one or more of the following Permitted Uses
will apply to your use of Software.  Unless you have an Entitlement that
expressly permits it, you may not use Software for any of the other Permitted
Uses.  If you don't have an Entitlement, or if your Entitlement doesn't cover
additional software delivered to you, then such software is for your Evaluation
Use.

(a) Evaluation Use.  You may evaluate Software internally for a period of 90
days from your first use.

users in an extranet deployment, but not to your affiliated companies or to
government agencies.

4.  Licensed Units.

Your Permitted Use is limited to the number of Licensed Units stated in your
Entitlement.  If you require additional Licensed Units, you will need additional
Entitlement(s).

5.  Restrictions.

(a) The copies of Software provided to you under this Agreement are licensed,
not sold, to you by Sun.  Sun reserves all rights not expressly granted.  (b)
You may make a single archival copy of Software, but otherwise may not copy,
modify, or distribute Software.  However if the Sun documentation accompanying

libraries, reference source code, and/or redistributable files, that may be
handled differently, you may do so only as provided in the Sun documentation.
(c) You may not rent, lease, lend or encumber Software.  (d) Unless enforcement
is prohibited by applicable law, you may not decompile, or reverse engineer
Software.  (e) The terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to any
Software updates, provided to you at Sun's discretion, that replace and/or
supplement the original Software, unless such update contains a separate
license.  (f) You may not publish or provide the results of any benchmark or
comparison tests run on Software to any third party without the prior written
consent of Sun.  (g) Software is confidential and copyrighted.  (h) Unless
otherwise specified, if Software is delivered with embedded or bundled software
that enables functionality of Software, you may not use such software on a
stand-alone basis or use any portion of such software to interoperate with any
program(s) other than Software.  (i) Software may contain programs that perform
automated collection of system data and/or automated software updating services.
System data collected through such programs may be used by Sun, its
subcontractors, and its service delivery partners for the purpose of providing
you with remote system services and/or improving Sun's software and systems.
(j) Software is not designed, licensed or intended for use in the design,
construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility and Sun and its
licensors disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses.
(k) No right, title or interest in or to any trademark, se rvice mark, logo or
trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted under this Agreement.

6.  Java Compatibility and Open Source.

Software may contain Java technology.  You may not create additional classes to,
or modifications of, the Java technology, except under compatibility
requirements available under a separate agreement available at www.java.net.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source developers,
and thanks the community for its important contributions and open
standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and open
source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern the use of
those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not alter any rights and
obligations you may have under such open source licenses, however, the
disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provisions in this Agreement
will apply to all Software in this distribution.

7.  Term and Termination.

The license and service term are set forth in your Entitlement(s).  Your rights
under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you
materially breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its
licensors' rights to Software.  Sun may terminate this Agreement should any
Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, the subject of
a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation.
Upon termination, you will cease use of, and destroy, Software and confirm
compliance in writing to Sun.  Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive
termination of the Agreement.

8.  Limited Warranty.

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of purchase, as
evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if
any) will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use.
Except for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your exclusive remedy
and Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's option
to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.  Some states do
not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply
to you.  This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights.  You may have
others, which vary from state to state.

9.  Disclaimer of Warranty.

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS,
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE
DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY
INVALID.

10.  Limitation of Liability.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE
THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE
SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In
no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including
negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this
Agreement.  The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated
warranty fails of its essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion
of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be
applicable to you.

11.  Export Regulations.

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials delivered under
this Agreement are subject to U.S.  export control laws and may be subject to
export or import regulations in other countries.  You agree to comply strictly
with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that you have the responsibility
to obtain any licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required after
delivery to you.

12.  U.S.  Government Restricted Rights.

If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S.  Government or by a
U.S.  Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the
Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation will be only as
set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through
227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101
and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

13.  Governing Law.

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law and
controlling U.S.  federal law.  No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will
apply.

14.  Severability.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement
will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless omission would
frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will
immediately terminate.

15.  Integration.

This Agreement, including any terms contained in your Entitlement, is the entire
agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter.  It supersedes all
prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals,
representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional
terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the
parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.  No
modification of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by
an authorized representative of each party.

Please contact Sun Microsystems, Inc.  4150 Network Circle, Santa Clara,
California 95054 if you have questions.</pre>
